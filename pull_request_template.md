This document provides details about what is required to review your PR.

## Summary ##
A short description of what the changes are and what they address. At most, one paragraph. Be sure to include a link to the Jira item for the code you're merging.

## Details ##
Only use this portion if necessary. Ideally, everything is concisely explained above.

## Minimum Requirements ##
Your code MUST pass the defined pipeline to be reviewed. This means all tests are passing, code has been formatted, the linter has no issues, and there are no merge conflicts.

If there are merge conflicts, you are expected to resolve them before anyone can properly review your code.

## Naming ##
Be sure to use certain keywords in the naming of your PR to automatically update tags
- [TODO] What are the keywords?
- What else should be in this list?
